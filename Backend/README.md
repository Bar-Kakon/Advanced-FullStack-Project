# Backend

Express + Mongoose API server for the Contractor Coordination Platform. TypeScript only.

The project source of truth is [`../Contractor Coordination Platform — Pro.md`](../Contractor%20Coordination%20Platform%20—%20Pro.md);
the schema reference is [`../docs/database-design.html`](../docs/database-design.html). Permanent
rules for working on this directory are in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Run it

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in MONGODB_URI and CORS_ORIGINS
npm run dev                 # watch mode
```

| Script | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Runs `src/server.ts` in watch mode |
| `npm run build` | Type-checks and emits `dist/` |
| `npm start` | Runs the built `dist/server.js` |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-checks without emitting |

Verify it is up:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# {"status":"ok","uptimeSeconds":3,"timestamp":"…","database":"connected"}
```

## Layout

Organised by responsibility, not by frontend screen. A branch named after a screen adds code to the
domain module that owns the responsibility, so two screens sharing a responsibility share one module.

```
src/
├── server.ts              process entry: env file → config → database → listen → graceful shutdown
├── app.ts                 Express application factory; importable without starting a listener
├── config/
│   ├── env.ts             the only reader of process.env; validates and returns AppConfig
│   └── cors.ts            turns the configured allowlist into CorsOptions
├── db/
│   └── mongoose.ts        connect / disconnect / status
├── middleware/
│   ├── validateRequest.ts JOI request-validation boundary
│   ├── notFoundHandler.ts unmatched route → AppError(…, 404, 'ROUTE_NOT_FOUND')
│   └── errorHandler.ts    the single place a failure becomes a response
├── routes/
│   ├── index.ts           API composition root — where feature routers mount
│   └── health.routes.ts   infrastructure-only GET /api/health
└── shared/
    ├── errors.ts          AppError
    └── logger.ts          the single stdout/stderr boundary
```

Feature modules land in `src/features/<domain>/` and mount in `routes/index.ts` with one line. That
directory does not exist yet because creating it empty would be scaffolding for its own sake.

## API error contract

Every deliberate failure answers with an HTTP status, a stable machine-readable `code`, and a
human-readable `message`:

```json
{ "code": "ROUTE_NOT_FOUND", "message": "Route GET /api/nope not found" }
```

Anything not deliberately raised answers `500` with
`{ "code": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR", "message": "Internal server error" }`. The exception, its
message and its stack stay server-side.

Codes are added **only** when a concrete expected failure is implemented — no vocabulary is defined
ahead of the conditions that need it. Everything this branch actually implements:

| Code | Status | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `ROUTE_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | No route matched the request |
| `REQUEST_VALIDATION_FAILED` | 400 | The request failed its JOI schema |
| `MALFORMED_JSON_BODY` | 400 | The body could not be parsed as JSON |
| `REQUEST_BODY_TOO_LARGE` | 413 | The body exceeded the 100kb limit |
| `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | 500 | Anything unexpected |

400 is used for request-shape failures so that 422 keeps the meaning it has in the schema doc's one
documented usage — a well-formed request rejected by a domain invariant.

## Deliberately not decided here

**D16 — 403 vs 404 for a resource the viewer may not see — is open and this branch does not touch
it.** `notFoundHandler` answers "no route matched" and nothing else; there is no reusable
not-found abstraction that an authorization check could pick up and thereby settle D16 by accident.

When D16 is decided it must cover the case where **the existence of a resource or relationship is
itself confidential**. Confidential delegation (§3.3) is exactly that case: a 403 confirms the
resource exists, which is precisely what the visibility model protects, so 404 may be required in
order to conceal existence rather than merely to report absence. The decision therefore belongs
with the Stage-5 viewer-aware serializer, not with route matching.
